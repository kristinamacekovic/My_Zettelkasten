# Takeaways
Suppose we start with an initial (income distribution for a) _population_. If the _actors_ in the population interact with each other based on a certain _transaction_, we always end up with the same distribution after a certain number of transactions. This is true even if we change any of the following parameters:
- initial distribution
- transaction function
- if actors can act only locally or globally (i. e. with anyone, not just neighbors)
With this, we always end up in a more unequal final state, expressed using the Gini coefficient (0.22-0.5 in this case). This distribution has a density expressed using the _beta function_.

We can arrive at these results using 3 different thinking approaches:
- mathematical: using Markov chains, purely theoretical
- statistical: using "smaller" simulations and drawing on genetic research, between theoretical and empirical
- computational: using a larger simulation size, i. e. purely empirical
