# Takeaways
The mnemonic medium:
* Memory systems make memory into a choice, rather than an event left up to chance
* Memory systems are in their infancy
* What would a virtuoso use of the mnemonic medium look like?
* Memory systems can be used to build genuine conceptual understanding, not just learn facts
* Mnemonic techniques such as memory palaces are great, but not versatile enough to build genuine conceptual understanding
* Memory is far more important than people tend to think

Other ideas:
* What practices would lead to tools for thought as transformative as Hindu-Arabic numerals? And in what ways does modern design practice and tech industry product practice fall short? To be successful, you need an _insight-through-making loop_ to be operating at full throttle, combining the best of deep research culture with the best of Silicon Valley product culture.
* Tools for thought are (mostly) public goods, and as a result are undersupplied: That said, there are closely- related models of production which have succeeded (the games industry, Adobe, AutoDesk, Pixar). 
* Take emotion seriously
* Tools for thought must be developed in tandem with deep, original creative work
